Please follow these simple guidelines for submission:
	1. Please send a .PNG or .GIF of high quality, a low-res preview version will be generated for the site.
	2. Add the image to this E-Mail as an attachment.
	3. You can make NSFW fanart, but I won't be able to put it on the website. I have no problem with NSFW fanart, but I just can't put it on the site as of now because my web host does not allow pornographic content. (if I switch web hosts to one that allows it this rule will change)
	4. Please include a title for the image to be used on the link on the fanart page, and please include a link to your personal blog/website/social page/whatever for me to link to to credit you :D (if you wish to have no link or wish to have no name and remain anonymous, then just say so in the E-Mail and I will exclude the link/your name)
	5. DONT FORGET THE EMO HAIR OR I SWEAR TO GOD ILL BREAK YOUR NECK PEOPLE KEEP FORGETTING IT
